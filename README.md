Welcome to my personal Power BI portfolio repository! Here you will find a collection of Power BI projects and dashboards that demonstrate my skills and foundation in data visualization, business intelligence, and analytics using Power BI.

# About Me

I am a passionate data enthusiast with a strong background in Power BI. I have extensive experience in transforming raw data into meaningful insights, creating interactive dashboards, and helping businesses make data-driven decisions. This portfolio showcases my proficiency in Power BI and highlights my ability to effectively communicate complex data visually.

# Objective project

# Use data analytics skills in a business scenario
As you’ve been learning, data analysts have inherent analytical skills, whether they know it or not. In other words, the interests that have led you to pursue a career as a data analyst create a foundation that you will build on throughout your career. To review, these skills are:

•	Curiosity

•	Understanding of context

•	Technical mindset

•	Data design

•	Data strategy

It’s important to recognize these skills and begin applying them to all sorts of situations. In this reading, you’ll do that through a case study based on a fictitious film production company, Mega-Pik International. 

# Scenario: Use data to create better movies

The movies Mega-Pik has released recently aren’t having the impact they used to. Five of their last six releases barely broke even at the box office, and the sixth film lost a lot of money. The lead executives at Mega-Pik have noticed that their competitors went through a similar slump, but recovered when they started producing remakes of past successes and marketing them to a new audience. 

Mega-Pik is interested in following this trend. They want to do this based on data-driven strategies, so they hire your analytics company to help them make popular movies again. Specifically, they ask for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to help them understand what audiences have liked in the past and determine if the successes of those films can be replicated. 

You and your team develop the following objectives for Mega-Pik’s EDA:

•	Identify key factors that contribute to a movie's opening weekend success.

•	Understand the relationship between a movie's budget and its revenue.

•	Determine which genres are most successful. 




The right dataset
Your company collects, cleans, and organizes the following relevant information into a dataset:

•	Movie name

•	Release date

•	Opening night revenue

•	Opening weekend revenue

•	Budget (cost to create)

•	Marketing costs

•	Ratings

•	Genre

1. Based on visualization, we can identify key factors that contribute to a movie's opening weekend success. These factors include the release date being on a weekend, the genre being Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi which are popular genres in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Additionally, famous directors such as Anthony and Joe Russo, Joss Whedon, and Jon Watts, as well as a renowned cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, and Chris Hemsworth, play a significant role in the success of a movie.

I have detected the top 5 movies that have been most successful based on famous directors and casts, such as Iron Man, Captain America, Scarlett, Black Window, and others. Among these movies, "The Avengers" stands out as the most profitable. In summary, through data visualization, we can determine the top 5 most profitable, the success in achieving high profits is closely tied to the director, cast, release date, and genre.


2. Based on data visualization, the relationship between a movie's budget and its revenue is evident. Even if a significant budget is allocated, the profit generated often surpasses the initial investment. This indicates that movies with larger budgets tend to yield profits higher than their expenses. Therefore, it can be concluded that the success of a movie is not solely determined by the size of its budget. Regardless of whether the outcome is modest or substantial, the fact remains that the movie performs well and does not incur losses.

3. The genres that I determine are most successful based on profit analysis is Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi.
